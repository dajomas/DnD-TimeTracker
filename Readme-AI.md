It started as a try-out but became this really nice utility so I decided to share it with the world.

Here are the prompts I used to get to this version:
* I would like to have a website that can track D&D time, it must be able to be paused during combat and add each combat round as the defined time. Can you create this using javascript?
* Can you add your suggestions of Short Rest and Long Rest buttons, make the ROUND_SECONDS and the duration of the rests customizable and use localStorage to persist time even after closing the browser?
* Can you add the option to start countdown timers?
* Can you make the duration input 3 fields (hour,minutes,seconds)
* In stead of opening a popup when a timer runs out, can you add 2 buttons to that timer section, one to acknowledge and stop the timer and one to reset the timer and make the section of that specific timer flash until one of the buttons is pressed?
* Can you change the acknowledge button to a restart button?
* Can you add an iteration number to the page title?
* Can you add a reset button that resets all timers?
* Can you add a color picker for each timer (defaults to red) to change the flashing color when it runs out?
* In the countdown section, can you make the input fields the same size, 3 characters wide. And change the button caption "Start Countdown" to "Add Countdown"
* Can you remove the text "Iteration" from the iteration counter and remove the label "Color:" from the colorpicker?
* In the main section, can you place the inputs for Combat round, short rest and long rest on separate rows? And move the buttons for "Add combat round", "Add Short Rest" and "Add Long Rest" on a separate row?
* Can you align the Combat Round, Short Rest and Long Rest input fields and make them 4 characters wide and add the unit behind the input field in stead of in the label
* Can you add a second iteration value that does not reset when the timer is reset?
* Can you remove the label for the Total field and add a Reset Total button for each timer
* Can you reformat the passed time to display "number of days" days HH:MM:SS?
* can you format the passed time so it looks more fancy?

And the Readme was created with the following promtp:
* Can you write a readme for this ?

I expect you will not get the exact same results when you try this on another AI platform or even Perplexity.
